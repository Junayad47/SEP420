                        Welcome to SEP420. In this course, we will explore the fundamentals of designing and developing web applications.
                        
                        This course is delivered in-person in the scheduled classroom. Please check your timetables for any last minute room
                        assignment changes. The majority of the class will be delivered in person, however, there may be the occasional session
                        that is delivered virtually. These classes will be announced in-advance.
                        
                        Our first session will be held Tuesday's starting at 8:15am. In the session, we will discuss the course overview and the
                    tools and technologies required. Although we are assigned an in-person computer lab, I suggest using your own laptop as
                    the computer labs may not always have the required software and/or admin access.
                    
                    I look forward to meeting you.
